#### By _**{List of contributors}**_

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_

* _JavaScript_
* _jQuery_

## Description

_{This is a detailed description of your application. Give as much detail as needed to explain what the application does as well as any other information you want users or other developers to have.}_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _View this content via a website hosted on GitHub by following this [link](https://morganjbradford.github.io/programmingLanguageSuggester/)_

_**Alternatively**_

1. Clone this repository from GitHub
2. Navigate to the top directory
3. Use your favorite browser to open [index.html](index.html)

_Details_: using terminal, navigate to the directory you would like to download this directory to. For this example we will be navigating to desktop. For any commands, type what is in between the 'single' quotation marks. To navigate to desktop, type 'cd ~/desktop'. To confirm your location enter 'pwd'. You should receive a message similar to "/c/Users/vampi/desktop" in this instance my location translates to "/hard drive c/Users folder/user/desktop". The last entry "desktop" is my current directory, and just happens to be inside of the other directories previously listed.

**Note: If you have a directory named programmingLanguageSuggester located here before using this next command, you may run into issues. To see a list of directories in your current location enter 'ls' in the terminal.**

Next, enter the following command 'git clone https://github.com/MorganJBradford/programmingLanguageSuggester.git'

The terminal should return with something similar to:

> Cloning into 'portfolio'...
> 
> remote: Enumerating objects: 99, done.
> 
> remote: Counting objects: 100% (99/99), done.
> 
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (70/70), done.
> 
> remote: Total 99 (delta 37), reused 87 (delta 25), pack-reused 0
> 
> Receiving objects: 100% (99/99), 2.68 MiB | 4.89 MiB/s, done.
> 
> Resolving deltas: 100% (37/37), done.

Next enter the command "ls" which should return with a list of files and directories. Mine returned with:

desktop.ini  icebreaker/  portfolio/ programmingLanguageSuggester/

Because I did not have a directory named programmingLanguageSuggester, I know it downloaded successfully. Now you should have an icon for the directory named programmingLanguageSuggester on your desktop background. Double click on the icon, this should open the directory. Right click on "index.html" select open, _or_ select open with if you have multiple web browsers and would like to use a specific one.
