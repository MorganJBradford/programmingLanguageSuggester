    <h3>Below, you'll be asked a series of questions in order to determine your ideal pl.</h3>
    <p>
      Our <strong>well paid</strong> mathemagicians have spent eons developing the following tool. Near the dawn of humanity, these same mathemagicians had visions of the future, and realized one day there would be a dilemma of global scale. In the age known as Choiceus-Extravagansus, there would be too many programming languages for aspiring computer programmers to choose from, and shortly thereafter, many languages would become extinct. To negate the mass hysteria that would ensue upon multi-pl extinction, these mathemagicians delved deeper into the future to determine the dominant pl(s). With the knowledge acquired, the following tool was created to determine which of the dominant pl's is perfect for you! Answer just 5 questions, and you'll know where your career should lie:

        You should learn C#! C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines.

      <h4>Python</h4>
      <p>
        You should learn Python! Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

      <h4>Swift</h4>
      <p>
        You should learn Swift! Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. and the open-source community, first released in 2014. Swift was developed as a replacement for Apple's earlier programming language Objective-C, as Objective-C had been largely unchanged since the early 1980s and lacked modern language features. Swift works with Apple's Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, and a key aspect of Swift's design was the ability to interoperate with the huge body of existing Objective-C code developed for Apple products over the previous decades. It is built with the open source LLVM compiler framework and has been included in Xcode since version 6, released in 2014. On Apple platforms,[11] it uses the Objective-C runtime library which allows C, Objective-C, C++ and Swift code to run within one program.
